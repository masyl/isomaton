# Backstage as a UI

An area of the isograph outside of the stage (typically behind or below) could be used to show some game UI such as:
- Player and actor's inventory
- Actor's health, mana and status
- Player power/mana bar
- An Acts' goals & achievements
-

By using the isograph, it is easy to manipulate. Transition of game elements from the stage to the inventory or state display could seemless and animated using the isograph.

Items backstage would also have to be "outside" of the game scope to prevent physical interactions between backstage and on stage blocks.

This way, a Health bar becomes trivial to show, deplete, fill, animate, etc.

Also, this give the user a firm and fixed place where he can interact with and affect the actor without having to poke the stage.

For example, dropping a power-up or curse on an actor is as easy as focusing on the actor, and moving a player inventory block onto the actor's block representation.
