# INDIRECTIONS GAMEPLAY

It would be the typical thing for the gameplay to let you control the character and start moving it arrount from one end of the screen to the other and bash, push and shove everything in sight. It is direct control of the character.

For Isomatron, a different approach is needed. In opposition to direct control, Isomaton is about indirect control, second degree influences of characters and more about intuitive guesswork and unforseen reactions than direct predictable control.

The game, its actors and its environment has a life of its own, which you can affect with only a few action, or shuffle the whole board if you have accumulated the tools and power. It should even be possible to lay back and simply let an act play out by itself and having your character come out victorious by himself, or die.


## The ACT OF GOD model

In this model, the user can be given control over the elements such as :
- lightning
- rain, snow and weather
- temperature
- day/night

All those actions are indirect and except for lightning, they are all "soft" actions that will not necessarely change the odds in an instant.


## The CHEATING GOD model

In this model, the user can cheat reality by outright breaking the rules:
- Recussitate an actor
- Instant death an actor
- Teleport an actor
- Freeze an actor
-

Some of these powers might not be a good idea in some acts and could be disabled.

## The EMPOWERING GOD model

In this model, the user can upgrade or boost the actors:
- Regain health
- More strength
- More speed
- More resistance

## The EDITOR GOD model

In this model, the user will edit the stage
- Add/remove blocks
- Move, push, pull blocks
- Freeze blocks

## The ALCHEMIST model

In this model the user can use gathered items and create postions and other items, and then poored on actors to get changes.
