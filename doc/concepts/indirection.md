INDIRECTIONS GAMEPLAY

It would be the typical thing for the gameplay to let you control the character and start moving it arrount from one end of the screen to the other and bash, push and shove everything in sight. It is direct control of the character.

For Minicraft, a different approach is needed. In opposition to direct control, Minicraft is about indirect control, second degree influences of characters and more about intuitive guesswork and unforseen reactions than direct predictable control.

The game, its actors and its environment has a life of its own, which you can affect with only a few action, or shuffle the whole board if you have accumulated the tools and power. It should even be possible to lay back and simply let an act play out by itself and having your character come out victorious by himself, or die.
