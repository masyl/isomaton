TIME SHIFTING

By having an indirect gameplay where the cast of characters have a life and will of their own, the player becomes more of a god-like entity or a omnipresent narrator.

So if the player is above and looking down on the action, why not give the player control over the dimension of time.

While the player might not be able to affect the gameplay in anyway he wants, some feeling of power and controle could come from pausing, slowing down and fast-forwarding the action.

And if the game is a procedural and predictable state machine, you could even let the player rewing time back to any point in the gameplay and restart from anypoint.

At this point, time paradoxes and the notion of multiverse become part of the game play.

Let's say the player is playing back the past and see's all his past actions and suddenly interacts mid-stream. What happens? A time split occurs and a new timeline is created with a different outcome and a change to get a getter or worst outcome.

What if that other abandonned timeline still exist and is still available to the user? Could the user starts rewinding and splitting the timeline in multitudes of outcomes until he gets the outcome he wants ?

How about if the player could start to entangle multiple timelines ? Swap his character from one timeline to an other, thus moving the state and inventory of one version of the character into the situation of the other timeline ?

What if a character in difficulty could suddenly get the assistance of himself from another timeline or from his own future or past.

What if the player could fork the present into two timline by simlpy putting a bow over a cat... one lives, the other doesnt. Suddenly, the user see's two version of the story unfold side by side.

What if the player had creative constraints on how, when and how often he can fiddle with the timelines.

Moving a character between timlines could require a portal at identical location... or an incantation.... or a peculiar synchrony state between both timelines... or a special item.

When a user dies... the player doesnt have to click restart and the user doesnt have to cheat death by comming back to life. All he has to do is rewind back to where the character still had a chance of survival and try again a different way. An graphical representation of the timeline could even have a little skull at it's end.

And the user could still cheat death, by stealing the player from the timeline and into a null enthropy box until the danger goes away.

Could something be done with the corpse of a character? Could it become a game ressource. As the corpse of your character lays in one timline that keeps moving on, it could get picked up by the character from the other timeline and used as a decoy for a hungry zombie!

The potential for unexpected twist and turns in the gameplay are limitless.

Also, with such game mechanics, any fun and clever game outcome is always recorder and could be shared with others for braggin rights or simply for the joy of seing crazy things happen in the game.

Making the game states or timelines shareable could even make them reusable by other player... if your friend get the "situation" or item you need, why could he not copy you his timeline for use in your game? You need the "kill a giant orc to obtain an orc's teeth" achievement but cant find an Orc? Get your friend to send you his timeline where he found one. Step in his timeline, kill the orc and then come back! Voil√†!


PROBLEMS:

Other than the difficult handling of logic, there are some problems with this mechanic which relates to multiverse theory and the butterfly effect. The only manageable way to key track on states through time if to have the world be constructed and rewound in predictable and procedural way with false random numbers. But once a player starts running a specific version of the game he cant move to the new version if this new version has additionnal and new game logic. Any slight change will NOT recreate the same outcome.

So the game mechanics, gameplay and storyline must take in account the versionning of the world. And at some point, a player would have to "break" the past or other timelines in order to user newer versions of the game. This means that timelines can be usefull and fun, but ultimatelly volatile.

This same difficulty occurs when sharing between users, they must both use or have access to the same world version.

Funny enough, it is not impossible that each timeline or timeline piece would run on a specific world version.

Start your story on version 1.1, and suddenly the mechanics moves to version 1.3, and move your character fro 1.1 to 1.2? Oups, the game tells you that there ae paradoxes preventing the move.


Running multiple versions side by side could require some sort of inheritence... 1.2 inheriting from 1.1 and so on.

Or simply force the user to pick a timeline and abanon all the others whe he has to move to the next era (version).
