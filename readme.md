## About Isomaton

Isomaton is a game and laboratory where you watch and interact with a biology of automatons that live their life inside a small and closed isometric world.

Isomaton also aims to bring an original gameplay based on concepts such as time shifting, time travel, determinism, the multiverse, chaos theory, procedural generation, emergent behaviors and other concepts often less exploited in games.

## Like a Theater

The game has been conceptualised with a "theater" theme in mind. If you look at the object model in the code, you will find things like a Stage, Actors, Acts, etc. In other words the gameplay will be like a long piece of theater where each actor will play out their role in a succession of acts.

As the user, you will have the choice to let the acts unfold by themselves, or start medling with their world. If an act gets stuck and the hero cant seems to get his role straight... why not give him some help.

## HTML5

This game is built using HTML5 technologies such as Javascript and Canvas. It has served me as a good laboratory to test new coding techniques and ideas. It will eventually work on any HTML5 compatible browsers and I aim to make it work well on the iPad.

I also would like to have the game distributed on the Chrome Store eventually.
